## Challenge 1 - Time Converter:
The program works to Convert a 12-hour time like "8:30 am" or "8:30 pm" to 24-hour time (like "0830" or "2030")!
It defines a function, which will be given an hour (always in the range of 1 to 12, inclusive), 
a minute (always in the range of 0 to 59, inclusive), and a period (either "am" or "pm") as input.
The program returns a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.

## Challenge 2 - Two Positive Numbers:
This program defines a function that checks whether exactly two out of three given numbers are positive. 
It iterates through the provided numbers and counts the positive ones. 
If exactly two numbers are positive, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. 
The code demonstrates the function by accepting 3 user input numbers and printing the result.

## Challenge 3 - Consonant Value:
This is a program that defines a function that takes a string and removes the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) 
and then splits the string to create groups of consonant sequences. 
It calculates the value of each group by summing the position of each character in the alphabet plus one. 
The function returns the maximum value among these calculated values for each group of consonants. 
The code demonstrates the function by accepting a string into the function and printing the result.
